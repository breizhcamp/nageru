Nageru 1.1.0, February 24th, 2016

 - Support doing the H.264 encoding on a different graphics device from the one
   doing the mixing. In particular, this makes it possible to use Nageru on an
   NVIDIA GPU while still encoding H.264 video using Intel Quick Sync (NVENC
   is not supported yet) -- it is less efficient since the data needs to be read
   back via the CPU, but the NVIDIA cards and drivers are so much faster that it
   doesn't really matter. Tested on a GTX 950 with the proprietary drivers.

 - In the included example theme, fix fading to/from deinterlaced sources.

 - Various smaller compilation, distribution and documentation fixes.
