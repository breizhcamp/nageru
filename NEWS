Nageru 1.2.0, April 6th, 2016

 - Support for Blackmagic's PCI and Thunderbolt cards, using the official
   (closed-source) Blackmagic drivers. (You do not need the SDK installed, though.)
   You can use PCI and USB cards pretty much interchangeably.

 - Much more stable handling of frame queues on non-master cards. In particular,
   you can have a master card on 50 Hz and another card on 60 Hz without getting
   lots of warning messages and a 10+ frame latency on the second card.

 - Many new options in the right click menu on cards: Adjustable video inputs,
   adjustable audio inputs, adjustable resolutions, ability to select card for
   master clock.

 - Add support for starting with almost all audio processing turned off
   (--flat-audio).

 - The UI now marks inputs with red or green to mark them as participating in
   the live or preview signal, respectively. Red takes priority. (Actually,
   it merely asks the theme for a color for each input; the theme contains
   the logic.)

 - Add support for uncompressed video instead of H.264 on the HTTP server,
   while still storing H.264 to files (--http-uncompressed-video). Note that
   depending on your client, this might not actually be more CPU efficient
   even on localhost, so be sure to check.

 - Add a simpler, less featureful theme (simple.lua) that should be easier to
   understand for beginners. Themes are now also choosable with -t on the command
   line.

 - Too many bugfixes and small tweaks to list. In particular, many memory leaks
   in the streaming part have been identified and fixed.


Nageru 1.1.0, February 24th, 2016

 - Support doing the H.264 encoding on a different graphics device from the one
   doing the mixing. In particular, this makes it possible to use Nageru on an
   NVIDIA GPU while still encoding H.264 video using Intel Quick Sync (NVENC
   is not supported yet) -- it is less efficient since the data needs to be read
   back via the CPU, but the NVIDIA cards and drivers are so much faster that it
   doesn't really matter. Tested on a GTX 950 with the proprietary drivers.

 - In the included example theme, fix fading to/from deinterlaced sources.

 - Various smaller compilation, distribution and documentation fixes.
