Nageru is a live video mixer, based around the standard M/E workflow.


Features:

 - High performance on modest hardware (720p60 with two input streams
   on my Thinkpad X240[1]); almost all pixel processing is done on the GPU.

 - High output quality; Lanczos3 scaling, subpixel precision everywhere,
   white balance adjustment, mix of 16- and 32-bit floating point
   for intermediate calculations, dithered output.

 - Proper sound support: Syncing of multiple unrelated sources through
   high-quality resampling, freely selectable input, cue out for headphones,
   dynamic range compression, simple EQ (lowpass), level meters conforming
   to EBU R128.

 - Theme engine encapsulating the design demands of each individual
   event; Lua code is responsible for setting up the pixel processing
   pipelines, running transitions etc., so that the visual look is
   consistent between operators.

[1] For reference, that is: Core i7 4600U (dualcore 2.10GHz, clocks down
to 800 MHz after 30 seconds due to thermal constraints), Intel HD Graphics
4400 (ie., without the extra L4 cache from Iris Pro), single-channel DDR3 RAM
(so 12.8 GB/sec theoretical memory bandwidth, shared between CPU and GPU).


Nageru is in beta stage. It currently needs:

 - An Intel processor with Intel Quick Sync, or otherwise some hardware
   H.264 encoder exposed through VA-API.

 - Two or more Blackmagic USB3 cards, either HDMI or SDI. These are driven
   through the “bmusb” driver embedded in bmusb/, using libusb-1.0.
   Note that you will want a recent Linux kernel to avoid LPM (link power
   management) and bandwidth allocation issues with USB3.

 - Movit, my GPU-based video filter library (https://movit.sesse.net).
   Newer is almost certainly better; Nageru's needs tends to drive new
   features in Movit.

 - Qt 5.5 or newer for the GUI.

 - libmicrohttpd for the embedded web server.

 - ffmpeg for muxing, and for encoding audio.

 - Working OpenGL; Movit works with almost any modern OpenGL implementation,
   but Nageru has been tested with Mesa 10.x and 11.x only (you probably want
   11.x).

 - libzita-resampler, for resampling sound sources so that they are in sync
   between sources, and also for oversampling for the peak meter.

 - Lua, for driving the theme engine.


The patches/ directory contains some patches for upstream software that help
Nageru performance and/or stability. They are all meant for upstream, but
probably will not be in by the time Nageru is released. All except the bmusb
patch are taken to be by Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@google.com> (ie., my work
email, unlike Nageru itself and bmusb), and under the same license as the
projects they patch.

To start it, just hook up your equipment, type “make” and then “./nageru”.
It is strongly recommended to have the rights to run at real-time priority;
it will make the USB3 threads do so, which will make them a lot more stable.
(A reasonable hack for testing is probably just to run it as root using sudo,
although you might not want to do that in production.) Note also that if you
are running a desktop compositor, it will steal significant amounts of GPU
performance. The same goes for PulseAudio.

Nageru will open a HTTP server at port 9095, where you can extract a live
H264+PCM signal in QuickTime mux (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:9095/stream.mov).
It is probably too high bitrate (~25 Mbit/sec depending on content) to send to
users, but you can easily send it around in your internal network and then
transcode it in e.g. VLC. A copy of the stream (separately muxed) will also
be saved live to local disk.


The name “Nageru” is a play on the Japanese verb 投げる (nageru), which means
to throw or cast. (I also later learned that it could mean to face defeat or
give up, but that's not the intended meaning.)
