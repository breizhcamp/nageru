// Takes in samples from an input source, possibly with jitter, and outputs a fixed number
// of samples every iteration. Used to a) change sample rates if needed, and b) deal with
// input sources that don't have audio locked to video. For every input video
// frame, you call add_input_samples() with the pts (measured in seconds) of the video frame,
// taken to be the start point of the frame's audio. When you want to _output_ a finished
// frame with audio, you get_output_samples() with the number of samples you want, and will
// get exactly that number of samples back. If the input and output clocks are not in sync,
// the audio will be stretched for you. (If they are _very_ out of sync, this will come through
// as a pitch shift.) Of course, the process introduces some delay; you specify a target delay
// (typically measured in milliseconds, although more is fine) and the algorithm works to
// provide exactly that.
//
// A/V sync is a much harder problem than one would intuitively assume. This implementation
// is based on a 2012 paper by Fons Adriaensen, “Controlling adaptive resampling”
// (http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/papers/adapt-resamp.pdf). The paper gives an algorithm
// that converges to jitter of <100 ns; the basic idea is to measure the _rate_ the input
// queue fills and is drained (as opposed to the length of the queue itself), and smoothly
// adjust the resampling rate so that it reaches steady state at the desired delay.
//
// Parts of the code is adapted from Adriaensen's project Zita-ajbridge (based on the same
// algorithm), although it has been heavily reworked for this use case. Original copyright follows:
